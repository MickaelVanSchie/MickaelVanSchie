### Hello! My name is Mickael

I am a tech geek from Holland, currently I have completed 31 trips around the sun.
When I'm not programming I tend to do one of the following things, not in a particular order:

- Play some games (My preference for games is broad, I can enjoy a good shooter just as much as a tycoonalike game)
- Fiddle around with 3D-printers.
- Curse at said 3D-printers because the first layer did not stick to the buildplate.
- Fly with (FPV) drones in epic locations.
- Repair said drones because I crashed into {insert-solid-object-name-here} going about 1/4th the speed of sound.
- Explore amazing abandoned locations.
- Improve my programming skills by learning new frameworks or languages. (Right now I'm diving into C# with the Unity Game Engine)
